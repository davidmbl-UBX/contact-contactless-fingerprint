## Contact-Contactless Fingerprint Recognition (Deep Learning) üñê

The aim of this work was to implement a fingeprint recognition deep learning model to evidently teach the model with contact-based images and predict contactless fingerprint after immediate pre-processing using the same model.

### Pre-processing contactless images
- Uses OpenCV for live capture and finger tip detection
